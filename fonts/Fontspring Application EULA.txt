a. Embed the licensed Font into an unlimited number of copies and subsequent versions of the Application(s) (“App” or “Apps”).
b. Modify or convert the Font to improve the Font's appearance or performance in the App.  

2. Requirements and Restrictions 
Licensee agrees to abide by the following requirements and restrictions:
a. Licensee may embed the Font into ONLY the number of Apps specified in the Receipt. 
b. Licensee may not redistribute the Font with the App’s source code.
c. Licensee may not install the Font in the operating system the App runs on. 
d. Licensee may not embed the Font in any application software considered to be a plug-in, template, skin or theme. 
e. Licensee may not embed the Font in an App that enables an end user to create custom typesetting with the Font. 
f. Licensee may embed the Font in reports that the App saves or exports, provided that the reports are not sold for profit.  

3. Provision to Third Parties 
Licensee may temporarily provide the Font to a producer, publisher or other agent who is working on behalf of the Licensee, only if the producer, publisher, or other agent (1) agrees in writing to use the Font exclusively for Licensee’s work, according to the terms of this EULA, and (2) retains no copies of the Font upon completion of the work. 

Licensee may not otherwise distribute the Font to third parties or make the Font publicly accessible or available except by embedding or linking in accordance with this EULA.

4. Term
This EULA grants a perpetual license for the rights set forth in Paragraph 1 unless and until the EULA terminates under Paragraph 8.  Fontspring will not charge additional fees post purchase, annually or otherwise.

5. Other Usage
Licenses for desktop use, @font-face embedding, Ebooks and Epubs, product creation websites, website template distribution, website templates, and other uses not allowed by this Agreement may be available for an additional fee. Contact Fontspring at support@fontspring.com for more information.

6. Modifications 
Licensee may not modify the Font or create derivative works based upon the Font without prior written consent from Fontspring or the owning Foundry (“Foundry”) EXCEPT THAT Licensee may generate files necessary for embedding or linking in accordance with this EULA.  

7. Copyright
The Font is protected by copyright law.   The Foundry is the sole, exclusive owner of all intellectual property rights, including rights under copyright and trademark law.  Licensee agrees not to use the Font in any manner that infringes the intellectual property rights of the Foundry or violates the terms of this EULA.  Licensee will be held legally responsible, and indemnifies Fontspring, for any infringements on the foundry's rights caused by failure to abide by the terms of this EULA.

8. Termination
This EULA is effective until terminated. If Licensee fails to comply with any term of this EULA, Fontspring may terminate the EULA with 30 days notice.  This EULA will terminate automatically 30 days after the issuance of such notice.

9. Disclaimer and Limited Warranty
Fontspring warrants the Product to be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use for a period of twenty one (21) days from the date of delivery as shown on Receipt. Fontspring's entire liability, and Licensee’s exclusive remedy, for a defective product shall be, at Fontspring's election, either (1) return of purchase price or (2) replacement of any such product that is returned to Fontspring with a copy of the Receipt. Fontspring shall have no responsibility to replace the product or refund the purchase price if failure results from accident, abuse or misapplication, or if any product is lost or damaged due to theft, fire, or negligence. Any replacement product will be warranted for twenty one (21) days. This warranty gives Licensee specific legal rights. Licensee may have other rights, which vary from state to state.

EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED ABOVE, THE PRODUCT, IS PROVIDED “AS IS”. FONTSPRING MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Product rests upon Licensee. Neither Fontspring nor the Foundry warrants that the functions contained in the Product will meet Licensee’s requirements or that the operation of the software will be uninterrupted or error free.

FONTSPRING SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FROM LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, AND THE LIKE) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT EVEN IF FONTSPRING OR THE FOUNDRY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to Licensee.

10. Governing Law
This EULA is governed by the laws of the United States of America and the State of Delaware.

11.  Entire Agreement
This EULA, in conjunction with the receipt (“Receipt”) that accompanies each Font licensed from Fontspring or its distributors, constitutes the entire agreement between Fontspring and Licensee.

12.  Modification
The Parties may modify or amend this EULA in writing.

13. Waiver. The waiver of one breach or default hereunder shall not constitute the waiver of any subsequent breach or default.
